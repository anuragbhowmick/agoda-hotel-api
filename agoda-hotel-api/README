A RESTful API written in Scala, built on top of Play!

The API returns a list of hotels given a city. The list can be optionally returned price sorted (ASC/DESC). The Hotel DB (Name, City, Id, Price) is loaded from a csv file.
The API requests are authorized and throttled by api-keys.
     *   On exceeding the limit, api-key is suspended for next 5 minutes.
     *   Api key can have different rate limit set(from configuration) and if not present there is a global rate limit applied

To run the tests
    ${PROJECT_DIR}/bin/activator test

To start the application:
    ${PROJECT_DIR}/bin/activator run

Note : activator run will take some time in the first run for downloading the dependencies. Can take 5~10 minutes

The REST api is of the form

/api/hotels/search/city/:cityName

To use the REST API:

curl -X GET -H "x-api-key: k1" "127.0.0.1:9000/api/hotels/search/city/Amsterdam?sort=priceAsc"
curl -X GET -H "x-api-key: k1" "127.0.0.1:9000/api/hotels/search/city/Amsterdam?sort=priceDesc"
curl -X GET -H "x-api-key: k1" "127.0.0.1:9000/api/hotels/search/city/Amsterdam"
